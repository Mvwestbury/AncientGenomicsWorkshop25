# Introduction
In this exercise we will be covering some analyses of palaeogenomic data, how to simulate ancient DNA data, and evaluate the influences of potential aDNA biases in our results. Specifically we will investigate the impact of reference genome selection, the quality of the data, and the base call approach used in PCA, Neighbour joining tree, and D-statistic analyses.
## Getting started
 - Data needed for this exercise can be downloaded from …
 - Within this you will find:
  - “Results” - Example results from different tasks
“Reference_genomes” - reference genomes
“Spotted_map_bams” - Files mapped to the spotted hyena
“Striped_map_bams” - Files mapped to the striped hyena
Spotted and Cave hyena data are from https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aay0456
Striped hyena is from https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msy037
Aardwolf is from https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msab055
